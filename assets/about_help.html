<li><b>I have cleared all the filters, but some entries are still missing from the list.</b><br>
While the filters were applied, you might have deleted an entry. Press "Restore Deleted" 
from the menu and you should see all your entries.</li><br>

<li><b>I have restored the deleted entries, but some are still missing.</b><br>
Is there any filter applied? Make sure you have cleared all the filters.</li><br>

<li><b>I am trying to add an entry but it doesn't appear in the list.</b><br>
This happens when a filter is set and the entry you are trying to add doesn't meet the
criteria of the filter. Clear all the filters and you should see your entry.</li><br>

<li><b>I see some question marks in the description of my entry instead of other characters</b><br>
You have used either the _ or | character in your description. Unfortunately, it is not
possible to use these characters in this version and these will be replaced automatically.</li><br>

<li><b>After applying a filter, I get results
where the information used by the filter is not available. Is this normal?</b><br>
Yes, this is how the application is designed to work. A more detailed explanation is available in the user documentation.</li>
