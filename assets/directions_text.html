<h3><a id="trainfeet">2.1 On Foot</a></h3>
<p>There are different paths you can choose to reach the Forum on foot. The recommended one 
is slightly longer, but it has certain advantages: it makes traveling with a trolley easier, 
the streets are well lit and it is easier and safer to travel at night, the streets are 
large and with few intersections, so it is less likely to get lost. Overall, it should take about 
20 minutes to reach the Forum.</p>
<ol>
<li>Exit the Train Station on <b>Princess Street</b></li>
<li>Turn right and then walk straight, until the first intersection</li>
<li>Turn right in the intersection and go straight ahead. You should be crossing a large bridge in a few moments (<b>North Bridge</b>)</li>
<li>Keep walking and after a few minutes you will reach another intersection, with High Street.</li>
<li>North Bridge will end, but you will keep walking forward on <b>South Bridge</b></li>
<li>At some point, South Bridge will end and it will continue with <b>Nicolson Street</b> </li>
<li>Keep walking on Nicolson Street, and you will soon see a square on the right with a small garden in the middle </li>
<li>This is <b>Nicolson Square</b>, and here you will have to turn right. At this point, you might be able to see the Forum</li>
<li>After turning right, go forward until you reach <b>Potterow</b>. You should now clearly see the back of the Forum, a modern five storey white building</li>
